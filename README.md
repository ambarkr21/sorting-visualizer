# Sorting Algorithm Visualization

This Python application visualizes various sorting algorithms using Tkinter. It provides a graphical representation of sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. You can control the speed of sorting and the size of the array using sliders, and generate new random arrays to be sorted.

## Features

- **Graphical Representation:** Visualize sorting algorithms with interactive bar graphs.
- **Algorithm Selection:** Choose from Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
- **Array Size Control:** Adjust the size of the array from 3 to 30 elements.
- **Sorting Speed Control:** Set the speed of sorting from 1 to 1000 milliseconds.
- **Real-Time Updates:** View real-time updates of the sorting process.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python installations)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/ambarkr21/sorting-visualizer.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```

    ```

3. Run the application:

    ```
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage

1. **Generate Array:** Click the "Generate Array" button to create a new random array.
2. **Select Algorithm:** Choose the desired sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
3. **Adjust Settings:** Use the sliders to set the array size and sorting speed.
4. **Start Sorting:** Click the "Start Sorting" button to visualize the selected sorting algorithm.
